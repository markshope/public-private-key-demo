# Public Key / Private Key Demo
A web-based demonstration of public / private key pair concepts.

This is a web-based version of <a href="https://github.com/anders94/public-private-key-demo">Anders Brownworth's</a> public/private keys and signing demonstration with minor changes by <a href="https://github.com/markshope/public-private-key-demo">Mark Shope</a> for use as a teaching tool to explain concepts related to the legal field. Anders Brownworth's excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIDL_akeras">Demo Video</a> remains a classic.
